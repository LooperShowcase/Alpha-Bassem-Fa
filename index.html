      Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future is Ashlee
      Vance's biography of Elon Musk, published in 2015. The book traces Elon
      Musk's life from his childhood up to the time he spent at Zip2 and PayPal,
      and then onto SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity. In the book, Vance managed to
      get regular interviews with Musk, those close to him, and those who were
      with him at the most important points of his life; Musk had no control
      over the biography's contents.
